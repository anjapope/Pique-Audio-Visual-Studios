comic_005,The Live Echoes,Nov 24 2022,Mo Shirazi,"The Live Echoes is a limited series comic that accounts a history of the space cult by the same name. Isadora, a scientist from 1901, reconnects with a colleague, Reventon, to witness the first series of tests using his Diathermic machine. Reventon devises the machine to 'encourage' symptoms within seven patients he has collected in his asylum who share peculiar commonalities. The electroshock therapy results in a transcendence of consciousness where the thread that weaves all of the characters together is betrayed through a cerebral maze bouncing between the asylum in 1901 and an internet parish in 2017. The Live Echoes believe all consciousness can be connected through a computer network so that a strong channel can pulse through space and time to link other versions of Selves from different dimensions, creating an omnipotent consciousness. Led by Reventon in 2017, his desperation to piece together all minds from all times is driven by a grief that haunts him incessantly. As both the mad scientist at the turn of the century and the megalomaniac behind a laptop, Reventon searches for his wife through the nucleic tundra within every consciousness, dragging along a congregation of patients and apostles to the farthest reaching meccas of the mental universe.",comic,objects/small/The Live Echoes_iss_1.png,objects/thumbs/The Live Echoes_iss_1.png,
